Hello, the files here are produced by a junior programmer but a potential guy who had made up his mind to get into industry of data analysis. No doubt the guy is me, Carter!

If u are interested in how to collect information from websites runned by javascript, transform data between .csv and .json, and interact with database, mongoDB and sqlite3, in python, I'm confident that u would be excited after examine some files' tutorial,taking CSV2Json and Py_database and splinter_phantomJS for example. Of course, it would be beneficial for those who wanna get lat and lng of locations, program simple autorun programs, and know about tiny but useful thoughts in programming by browsing folders named as autotest, trick, and lat_lng.

Last but not least, the files, .json or .csv, u need to practice is upload already.

Hopefully these reults could become contributions to u guys.
